      6         Whistleblowers serve no function if they cannot tell their stories. The present story of
      7         whistleblowing—as discussed, in part, in 
      8         PLoS Medicine —that involves the pharmaceutical industry, pharmaceutical
      9         benefit management corporations, the managed care industry, and the political and lobbying
     10         forces that zealously guard their secrets could not have been told without the help of
     11         courageous men and women [1, 2] For that reason, those of us who congregated in Washington,
     12         D.C., on May 15th, 2005, at the invitation and support of the Public Library of Science and
     13         the Government Accountability Project feel particularly humbled and grateful to these two
     14         sponsors. Our convictions could not have been aired were it not for the essential First
     15         Amendment work of responsible journalists, who exemplify the best in investigatory
     16         research.
     17         For me, whistleblowing is not a theoretical exercise. It has a human face and tangible
     18         features. It is the face of children and adults who have been injured or killed by
     19         misrepresented pharmaceuticals; clinical research trial results that have been sequestered
     20         from the scientific community and whose incomplete findings cause injury; and
     21         pharmaceuticals that are detailed to physicians, not to save lives or necessarily improve
     22         the health or welfare of the recipients, but to make money.
     23         In the lonely and, at times, discouraging world of whistleblowing, we whistleblowers are
     24         passionate, and often successful, because our efforts have a different goal than the
     25         corporations and political interests whose operations we occasionally challenge. Our goal
     26         is to tell the truth. That honest effort is the source of any ethical difference we can or
     27         might make. Truth is the basis for the power of a whistleblower, one that can withstand the
     28         assault of unprecedented odds against being heard put forth by that sum of political power,
     29         expediency, and money.
     30         A whistleblower's success depends upon competent and articulate media. The debate to
     31         improve the status quo—be it in pharmaceutical marketing or managed-care decision
     32         making—cannot proceed or flourish without it.
     33         Ralph Waldo Emerson, American essayist and philosopher (1803–1882), commented about
     34         success (I have adapted his comments for all of us who gathered in Washington in mid-May
     35         2005): “To leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch or a
     36         redeemed social condition; to know even one life breathed easier because you have lived;
     37         this is to have succeeded [as a whistleblower].”

      5         Background
      6         The application of UHCT for the diagnosis of acute
      7         ureteric colic has positively influenced the practice of
      8         urology and uro-radiology. The technology allows the rapid
      9         and accurate determination of the presence of stone in the
     10         urinary tract. Since the pioneering study on the role of
     11         UHCT in the evaluation of ureteric colic by Smith et al [ 1
     12         ] in 1995, a number of studies have shown the superiority
     13         of non-contrast enhanced CT over IVU and Ultrasonography [
     14         2 3 4 5 ] . Its sensitivity and specificity is reported to
     15         be more than 95% and 96 % respectively [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 ] . An
     16         important disadvantage is a higher radiation dose to the
     17         patient [ 7 ] . Denton [ 8 ] noted a difference of 2.5 mSv
     18         versus 4.7 mSv in the radiation dose to the patient between
     19         IVU and UHCT performed for renal colic.
     20         Advantages of UHCT includes rapid scan time, avoidance
     21         of contrast related hazards, cost effectiveness, high
     22         accuracy, and its ability to suggest an alternative
     23         diagnosis for flank pain. This last characteristic of UHCT
     24         is valuable in diagnosing many significant diseases earlier
     25         in their course, which may be helpful in decreasing the
     26         associated morbidity. In this study, we are presenting our
     27         initial experience of diagnosing alternative or additional
     28         diseases on UHCT performed for the evaluation of acute
     29         flank pain.
     30       
     31       
     32         Methods
     33         The radiologist's reports on CT, CT films and medical
     34         records of 233 consecutive patients, performed between July
     35         2000 and August 2001 at a University Hospital for suspected
     36         renal/ureteral colic were reviewed. The UHCT were obtained
     37         on a Cti/pro single slice helical CT scanner (General
     38         Electrical medical systems, Milwaukee, WI). The exposure
     39         factors setting were KVp 130 and mAS 200-250. All scans
     40         were obtained from the upper border of T12 vertebral body
     41         to the lower border of symphysis pubis using 5 mm
     42         collimation, without the use of oral or intravenous
     43         contrast material. Patients were placed in supine position
     44         with full urinary bladder at the time of the UHCT.
     45         Additional prone films were taken whenever the radiologist
     46         needed a better description of suspected distal ureteric
     47         calculi. Radiological diagnoses of clinical entities
     48         otherwise suspected were analyzed. All relevant
     49         radiological, biochemical, serological investigations as
     50         well as per-operative findings were also analyzed.
     51       
     52       
     53         Results
     54         From July 19, 2000 to August 15, 2001, 233 patients had
     55         UHCT for the evaluation of acute flank pain. Ureteral
     56         calculi were identified in 148 examinations (64%), findings
     57         of recent passage of calculi in 10 (4%) and no calculus in
     58         75 (32%) scans. Thirty-two of the conservatively managed
     59         patients were lost to follow up and therefore were not
     60         included. In the remaining 201 patients, sensitivity and
     61         specificity of UHCT in diagnosing calculi was 99% and 98%
     62         respectively while +ve and -ve predictive value was 99% and
     63         98% respectively. Twenty-eight patients (12%) had
     64         alternative or additional diseases (other than renal,
     65         ureteric or bladder stone disease) diagnosed on UHCT.
     66         Table 1describes in detail the alternative or additional
     67         diagnoses.
     68         In 71 % of these cases, diagnosis was confirmed by the
     69         surgical procedure, biopsy and biochemical evaluation (in
     70         case of pancreatitis) as shown in Table 1.
     71       
     72       
     73         Discussion
     74         A wide variety of significant or potentially significant
     75         diagnoses can be identified on UHCT performed for suspected
     76         ureteral/renal colic [ 9 10 11 12 13 ] . Apart from its
     77         high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing stone
     78         disease, the characteristic of UHCT, which discriminates it
     79         from other modalities, is its ability to pick up other
     80         unsuspected significant clinical entities. Early diagnosis
     81         of diseases such as appendicitis, cholecystitis,
     82         pancreatitis, diverticulitis and leaking aortic aneurysm
     83         that require urgent and prompt treatment could affect the
     84         associated morbidity and mortality associated with such
     85         diseases. In a large series of 1000 UHCT for suspected
     86         renal/ureteric colic, Katz [ 13 ] reported 101 patients
     87         (10%) with alternative or incidental diagnosis.
     88         Table 2shows some of the major series published to date
     89         on this subject.
     90         Among the major series published on the subject [ 9 10
     91         11 12 13 ] , the incidence of unsuspected clinical entities
     92         was 10-15%. The disease pattern is remarkably similar in
     93         most series (Table 2). In one report from Albert Einstein
     94         Medical Center, Philadelphia, Marcella et al [ 8 ] noted an
     95         unusually high incidence of incidentally discovered renal
     96         cell cancer. There is low incidence of diverticulitis in
     97         South Asia and we have found no case of diverticulitis in
     98         our series by comparison to other series. It is important
     99         that in the absence of ureterolithiasis, particular care
    100         should be taken to rule out alternative diagnosis for flank
    101         pain.
    102         In our series, early diagnosis of pancreatitis,
    103         cholecystitis, mesenteric lymphadenitis, pyelonephritis and
    104         appendicitis, initiated early treatment. The alternative
    105         diagnosis of eight tumors in our series and similar trends
    106         in other series is interesting. It suggests that UHCT may
    107         change the prognosis in many cases that would otherwise be
    108         diagnosed late.
    109       
    110       
    111         Conclusion
    112         A wide variety of significant alternative or additional
    113         diagnoses can be reliably identified on UHCT performed for
    114         suspected renal/ureteric colic. In the present series, such
    115         diseases were diagnosed in 12% of cases. Unlike most series
    116         from the West we did not note any case of
    117         diverticulitis.

        important disadvantage is a higher radiation dose to the
        patient [ 7 ] . Denton [ 8 ] noted a difference of 2.5 mSv
        versus 4.7 mSv in the radiation dose to the patient between
        IVU and UHCT performed for renal colic.
        Advantages of UHCT includes rapid scan time, avoidance

        is valuable in diagnosing many significant diseases earlier

        initial experience of diagnosing alternative or additional
        diseases on UHCT performed for the evaluation of acute
        flank pain.
      
      
        Methods
        The radiologist's reports on CT, CT films and medical
        records of 233 consecutive patients, performed between July
        2000 and August 2001 at a University Hospital for suspected

        Additional prone films were taken whenever the radiologist

        otherwise suspected were analyzed. All relevant
        radiological, biochemical, serological investigations as

        Results
        From July 19, 2000 to August 15, 2001, 233 patients had
        UHCT for the evaluation of acute flank pain. Ureteral
        calculi were identified in 148 examinations (64%), findings
        of recent passage of calculi in 10 (4%) and no calculus in
        75 (32%) scans. Thirty-two of the conservatively managed
        patients were lost to follow up and therefore were not
        included. In the remaining 201 patients, sensitivity and
        specificity of UHCT in diagnosing calculi was 99% and 98%
        respectively while +ve and -ve predictive value was 99% and
        98% respectively. Twenty-eight patients (12%) had
        alternative or additional diseases (other than renal,
        ureteric or bladder stone disease) diagnosed on UHCT.
        Table 1describes in detail the alternative or additional
        diagnoses.
        In 71 % of these cases, diagnosis was confirmed by the
        surgical procedure, biopsy and biochemical evaluation (in
        case of pancreatitis) as shown in Table 1.
        
        
        Discussion
        A wide variety of significant or potentially significant
        diagnoses can be identified on UHCT performed for suspected
        ureteral/renal colic [ 9 10 11 12 13 ] . Apart from its
        high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing stone
        disease, the characteristic of UHCT, which discriminates it
        from other modalities, is its ability to pick up other
        unsuspected significant clinical entities. Early diagnosis
        of diseases such as appendicitis, cholecystitis,
        pancreatitis, diverticulitis and leaking aortic aneurysm
        that require urgent and prompt treatment could affect the
        associated morbidity and mortality associated with such
        diseases. In a large series of 1000 UHCT for suspected
        renal/ureteric colic, Katz [ 13 ] reported 101 patients
        (10%) with alternative or incidental diagnosis.
        Table 2shows some of the major series published to date
        on this subject.
        Among the major series published on the subject [ 9 10

        was 10-15%. The disease pattern is remarkably similar in
        most series (Table 2). In one report from Albert Einstein
        Medical Center, Philadelphia, Marcella et al [ 8 ] noted an
        unusually high incidence of incidentally discovered renal
        cell cancer. There is low incidence of diverticulitis in
        South Asia and we have found no case of diverticulitis in
        our series by comparison to other series. It is important
        that in the absence of ureterolithiasis, particular care
        should be taken to rule out alternative diagnosis for flank
        pain.
        In our series, early diagnosis of pancreatitis,
        cholecystitis, mesenteric lymphadenitis, pyelonephritis and
        appendicitis, initiated early treatment. The alternative
        diagnosis of eight tumors in our series and similar trends
        in other series is interesting. It suggests that UHCT may
        change the prognosis in many cases that would otherwise be
        diagnosed late.
      
      
        Conclusion
        A wide variety of significant alternative or additional
        diagnoses can be reliably identified on UHCT performed for
        suspected renal/ureteric colic. In the present series, such
        diseases were diagnosed in 12% of cases. Unlike most series
        from the West we did not note any case of
        diverticulitis.

        Background
        The application of UHCT for the diagnosis of acute
        ureteric colic has positively influenced the practice of
        urology and uro-radiology. The technology allows the rapid
        and accurate determination of the presence of stone in the
        urinary tract. Since the pioneering study on the role of
        UHCT in the evaluation of ureteric colic by Smith et al [ 1
        ] in 1995, a number of studies have shown the superiority
        of non-contrast enhanced CT over IVU and Ultrasonography [
        2 3 4 5 ] . Its sensitivity and specificity is reported to
        be more than 95% and 96 % respectively [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 ] . An
        important disadvantage is a higher radiation dose to the
        patient [ 7 ] . Denton [ 8 ] noted a difference of 2.5 mSv
        versus 4.7 mSv in the radiation dose to the patient between
        IVU and UHCT performed for renal colic.
        Advantages of UHCT includes rapid scan time, avoidance
        of contrast related hazards, cost effectiveness, high
        accuracy, and its ability to suggest an alternative
        diagnosis for flank pain. This last characteristic of UHCT
        is valuable in diagnosing many significant diseases earlier
        in their course, which may be helpful in decreasing the
        associated morbidity. In this study, we are presenting our
        initial experience of diagnosing alternative or additional
        diseases on UHCT performed for the evaluation of acute
        flank pain.
      
      
        Methods
        The radiologist's reports on CT, CT films and medical
        records of 233 consecutive patients, performed between July
        2000 and August 2001 at a University Hospital for suspected
        renal/ureteral colic were reviewed. The UHCT were obtained
        on a Cti/pro single slice helical CT scanner (General
        Electrical medical systems, Milwaukee, WI). The exposure
        factors setting were KVp 130 and mAS 200-250. All scans
        were obtained from the upper border of T12 vertebral body
        to the lower border of symphysis pubis using 5 mm
        collimation, without the use of oral or intravenous
        contrast material. Patients were placed in supine position
        with full urinary bladder at the time of the UHCT.
        Additional prone films were taken whenever the radiologist
        needed a better description of suspected distal ureteric
        calculi. Radiological diagnoses of clinical entities
        otherwise suspected were analyzed. All relevant
        radiological, biochemical, serological investigations as
        well as per-operative findings were also analyzed.
      
      
        Results
        From July 19, 2000 to August 15, 2001, 233 patients had
        UHCT for the evaluation of acute flank pain. Ureteral
        calculi were identified in 148 examinations (64%), findings
        of recent passage of calculi in 10 (4%) and no calculus in
        75 (32%) scans. Thirty-two of the conservatively managed
        patients were lost to follow up and therefore were not
        included. In the remaining 201 patients, sensitivity and
        specificity of UHCT in diagnosing calculi was 99% and 98%
        respectively while +ve and -ve predictive value was 99% and
        98% respectively. Twenty-eight patients (12%) had
        alternative or additional diseases (other than renal,
        ureteric or bladder stone disease) diagnosed on UHCT.
        Table 1describes in detail the alternative or additional
        diagnoses.
        In 71 % of these cases, diagnosis was confirmed by the
        surgical procedure, biopsy and biochemical evaluation (in

        Animal models can play an essential role in guiding preclinical vaccine development,
        including in studies of preclinical vaccine safety, vaccine toxicity, and vaccine
        immunogenicity. Appropriate pathogen challenge models can also provide the opportunity to
        perform preclinical tests of vaccine efficacy. Preclinical tests of HIV vaccine efficacy
        are usually performed by exposing macaques to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), a virus
        that is closely related to HIV. However, the viral inoculum sizes used to infect macaques
        with SIV vastly exceed the amounts of HIV that humans are exposed to during a given
        exposure. Typically animals are exposed to 10–100 times the infectious dose at which 50% of
        the animals become infected (ID50). These excessive doses may not provide realistic
        preclinical tests of vaccine efficacy. Indeed, no vaccine has been shown to be effective in
        preventing infection by SIV (so-called sterilizing immunity) in such high viral inoculum
        trials. Now, in a paper published in 
        PLoS Medicine , Roland Regoes and colleagues speculate that an
        alternative approach to trials in animals not only can mimic the human patterns of repeated
        low-dose exposure, but also can remove one concern for animal researchers—the need to use
        very large numbers of animals in experiments.
        What the researchers did was use statistical power analysis to compare a single low-dose
        challenge design, in which each animal is challenged only once, and a repeated low-dose
        challenge design, in which each animal is challenged until it is infected or a
        predetermined maximum number of challenges is reached. The statistical power of an
        experimental design—a measure of the statistical quality—was assessed by simulating
        experiments, evaluating them, and then repeating the procedure thousands of times.
        What they found was that the experimental design using a single low dose of virus in
        each animal required unfeasibly large numbers of animals; even for the highest modeled
        vaccine efficacy of 90% the single low-dose challenge design required more than 20 animals
        per group to reach a statistical power of 95%. However, when the researchers modeled a
        protocol of repeatedly challenging the (virtual) animals with a challenge dose of one 
        ID
        50 , and allowing for a maximum number of 20 challenges of each
        individual animal, as few as five animals were required to achieve more than 95% of
        statistical power.
        Where do these results leave the design of HIV trials? To begin with, the results should
        encourage researchers to develop animal models that reflect, to the fullest extent
        possible, what is known about the natural history and pathogenesis of the disease in
        humans, rather than designing trials to fit the animal models that are available. The
        authors have made available the programming script of their analysis so anyone can repeat
