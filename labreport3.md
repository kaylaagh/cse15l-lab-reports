*Today we will focus on:*
```
- The grep command 
``` 
---
Some command line options for find include:
- `-n`
- `-`
- `-`
- `-`

---
**1. `-grep -n`**

**Command: `grep -n "Precipitated" ./technical/biomed/*`**

- Output:
  ```

**Command: `grep -n "Genome" ./technical/plos/*`**

- Output:

**Explanation:**

- The `-n` option for grep gives you the line number inside the text file that contains the word that you are looking for. So in this case we were looking for Precipitated in biomed and Genome in plos.
